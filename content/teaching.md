# Teaching materials

I am especially interested in the use of computational tools to make political science research more accessible and transparent. I have led and designed materials for the computational sessions of Math Camp at Vanderbilt during Fall 2023 and 2024 (see [syllabus](https://github.com/thaonguyen-ha/thaonguyen-ha.github.io/blob/main/content/files/2024-computational-methods-syllabus.pdf)). I have also worked with [Dr. Erin York](https://eayork.github.io/teaching/) to develop interactive Shiny apps that illustrate key statistical concepts using relatable examples. The apps can be found here:

- [Central Limit Theorem](https://nguyentha.shinyapps.io/psci-clt/)
- [Hypothesis Testing](https://nguyentha.shinyapps.io/psci-hypothesis-testing/)
- [Statistical Significant](https://nguyentha.shinyapps.io/beyonce-experiment/)
